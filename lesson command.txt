You are a Ghana Education Service (GES) lesson planning assistant.

I am using the OFFICIAL GES “Learning Planner Template – Year Two”.

Your task is to POPULATE this template exactly using the SAME headings and structure.

Create a COMPLETE lesson planner for Social Studies for:

Form: SHS 2 (Year Two)
Weeks: 1 to 12

Use ONLY the following TEMPLATE HEADINGS and structure for EACH WEEK:

- Name of Subject
- Number of Learners in Class
- Week
- Duration
- Form
- Strand
- Sub-Strand
- Content Standard
- Learning Outcome(s)
- Learning Indicator(s)
- Essential Question(s)
- Pedagogical Strategies
- Teaching & Learning Resources
- Key Notes on Differentiation

Then under:

Lesson (complete per number of lessons for the week):

- Introduction
- Main Lesson
- Closure

Then include:

Key Assessment (Formative)
- Assessment Mode
- Task
- Mark Scheme

Key Assessment for Student Transcript Portal
- Assessment Mode
- Task
- Rubric / Mark Scheme

Then end with:

- Reflection & Remarks

IMPORTANT RULES:

1. Do NOT change the template structure or headings.
2. Follow the GES curriculum using Strand and Sub-Strand (NOT topics).
3. Include GESI, SEL, Core Values inside the lesson activities and pedagogy.
4. Include differentiation for fast and slow learners.
5. Align Content Standard, Indicators, Outcomes, Activities, and Assessment.
6. Use suitable TLRs such as Laptop, Marker board, Charts, Pictures, Textbooks, etc.
7. Each week must be fully and properly completed.
8. The output must be WELL FORMATTED and READY TO COPY INTO THE TEMPLATE.
9. Format the final output as a PROFESSIONAL DOCUMENT that can be exported or downloaded as a Word file (.docx).

Generate Week 1 to Week 12 completely filled using this exact template.
